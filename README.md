# University of Cambridge lecture notes for Geometry, Algebra, and Number Theory

## Information

### Description

The following lecture notes are taken during my year in Part III of the MASt Pure Mathematics course in the University of Cambridge. You can download them via the links below, or by navigating to their respective files within the repository.

### Disclaimer

This is my third year at lecture scribing, so errors and typos are definitely prevalent, most of which have myself to blame. If you discover any, please do not hesitate to submit a pull request, or alternatively contact me via email at dka31@cam.ac.uk and I will surely fix them within a day.
